            <h2>What are Rube Goldberg Machines? Why do we build them?</h2>
            <img src="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/goldberg.jpg" alt="Rube Goldberg" class="right-image">

            <p>In the early 1900s, an engineer-turned-cartoonist named Rube Goldberg became famous for his illustrations of complex machines designed to accomplish simple tasks. These machines typically involve a series of simple, unrelated mechanisms, where the action of one triggers the next, culminating in the desired result.</p>

            <p>In recent years, Rube Goldberg machines have gained popularity in engineering education. They offer a fun and engaging way to explore fundamental physics principles such as energy transfer, cause and effect, and mechanics. By showcasing intricate chain reactions to complete simple tasks, these machines encourage critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, making them a valuable tool for STEM education.</p>

            <p>For mechanical engineering students, designing a Rube Goldberg machine is an excellent exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems. It reinforces essential skills required for future design challenges, providing hands-on experience throughout the process.</p>

            <p>In addition to benefiting students, a well-designed Rube Goldberg machine has value for other stakeholders. These stakeholders are explored in the following sections.</p>
        </section>

 

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
            <p>There are four main stakeholders involved in this project:</p>

            <h3>Creator</h3>
            <p>As the creator of the Rube Goldberg machine, I gain hands-on experience in design, problem-solving, and teamwork while applying theoretical concepts to a real-world project. My primary concerns are ensuring that my subassembly works seamlessly within the larger machine, receiving the input force provided by the preceding subassembly and outputting sufficient force for the next one.</p>

            <p>To guide the design process, I established clear requirements: the subassembly must receive an input force of at least 2 N and output a force of at least 1.5 N. These criteria ensure functionality and compatibility within the larger system.</p>

            <h3>Other Students</h3>
            <p>My classmates, particularly those responsible for the subassemblies before and after mine, are key stakeholders. For the overall machine to function, my subassembly must efficiently transfer energy. Specifically, it must transmit at least 90% of the energy it receives as input to ensure smooth integration with their designs.</p>

            <h3>Instructor</h3>
            <p>The instructor oversees the project's success, ensuring that each subassembly is functional, meets the project guidelines, and adheres to fundamental engineering principles. They also require that my subassembly be completed on time and align with technical and functional specifications. Additionally, thorough documentation and reflection on the design process, including design decisions and problem-solving strategies, are essential to meet the instructor's expectations.</p>

            <h3>Users of the Machine</h3>
            <p>Future engineers or students studying mechanical design may use this subassembly as a learning tool. For these users, it is important that the design is well-documented, with clear explanations of the engineering principles involved. The subassembly should be understandable and replicable by someone with basic engineering knowledge. Moreover, the entire machine must operate smoothly, from the first subassembly to the last, to serve as an effective educational example.</p>
        </section>

       <section class="section">
            <h2>Existing Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>Rube Goldberg machines often utilize a wide variety of mechanisms to create intricate chain reactions. Here are some common mechanisms typically employed in these machines:</p>

            <ul class="requirements-list">
                <li><strong>Levers:</strong> Simple levers are used to amplify force or trigger movements. They are often integrated with other mechanisms like pulleys and ramps.</li>
                <li><strong>Pulleys:</strong> Pulleys help change the direction of force, making them ideal for lifting or lowering objects in a sequence.</li>
                <li><strong>Inclined Planes:</strong> Ramps allow objects to roll or slide, transferring kinetic energy to the next step in the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Domino Chains:</strong> A classic feature in many machines, domino chains rely on potential energy stored in vertical pieces to create a cascading effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Mechanisms:</strong> Springs store potential energy, which can be released to move objects or create forceful impacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotational Elements:</strong> Gears, spinning disks, or rotating arms are used to transmit motion in creative ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical Components:</strong> Simple circuits and switches can add a mechatronic element, incorporating lights, sounds, or motorized movements.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Three of these mechanisms are explored in detail below:</p>

            <h3>Domino Knockdown Mechanism</h3>
            <img src="https://content.instructables.com/FZ8/2KLE/IUYD2BQN/FZ82KLEIUYD2BQN.jpg" alt="Domino Knockdown Mechanism" class="domino-image-small">
            <p>A popular subassembly in Rube Goldberg machines involves a series of dominoes that, when knocked down in sequence, trigger the next action.</p>
	    <p>The dominos are usually made of wood, plastic, or metal, with uniform size and weight. The mechanism relies on the principle of potential energy stored 
in the standing dominoes, which is converted into kinetic energy when the first domino is pushed over. This energy transfer creates a chain reaction, knocking down the 
entire series in a mesmerizing display.<p><p> The mechanism is versatile and can serve as a transitional phase in a Rube Goldberg machine, where the falling dominoes trigger 
subsequent actions like hitting a lever, pressing a button, or releasing a ball.<p>
	&nbsp
	&nbsp
<h3>Ball Drop Mechanism</h3>
            <h3>Pulley System Mechanism</h3>
            <p>A pulley system is a common mechanism used to change the direction of force and move objects within a Rube Goldberg machine. Pulleys can be used to lift or lower objects or to transfer force across different parts of the machine. A simple pulley system may consist of a rope and a wheel, with the rope moving over the wheel to lift an object. When integrated into a larger system, pulleys can be used in tandem with other mechanisms like levers and ramps to create smooth transitions and ensure that force is transmitted across the machine with minimal friction.</p>
