            <h2>What are Rube Goldberg Machines? Why do we build them?</h2>
            <img src="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/goldberg.jpg" alt="Rube Goldberg" class="right-image">

            <p>In the early 1900s, an engineer-turned-cartoonist named Rube Goldberg became famous for his illustrations of complex machines designed to accomplish simple tasks. These machines typically involve a series of simple, unrelated mechanisms, where the action of one triggers the next, culminating in the desired result.</p>

            <p>In recent years, Rube Goldberg machines have gained popularity in engineering education. They offer a fun and engaging way to explore fundamental physics principles such as energy transfer, cause and effect, and mechanics. By showcasing intricate chain reactions to complete simple tasks, these machines encourage critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, making them a valuable tool for STEM education.</p>

            <p>For mechanical engineering students, designing a Rube Goldberg machine is an excellent exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems. It reinforces essential skills required for future design challenges, providing hands-on experience throughout the process.</p>

            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*UXeSA9hDKfUEfw4cE2pIpA.png" alt="A diagram showing an example of a Rube Goldberg machine" class="bottom-image">

            <p>In addition to benefiting students, a well-designed Rube Goldberg machine has value for other stakeholders. These stakeholders are explored in the following sections.</p>
        </section>

 

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
            <p>There are four main stakeholders involved in this project:</p>

            <h3>Creator</h3>
            <p>As the creator of the Rube Goldberg machine, I gain hands-on experience in design, problem-solving, and teamwork while applying theoretical concepts to a real-world project. My primary concerns are ensuring that my subassembly works seamlessly within the larger machine, receiving the input force provided by the preceding subassembly and outputting sufficient force for the next one.</p>

            <p>To guide the design process, I established clear requirements: the subassembly must receive an input force of at least 2 N and output a force of at least 1.5 N. These criteria ensure functionality and compatibility within the larger system.</p>

            <h3>Other Students</h3>
            <p>My classmates, particularly those responsible for the subassemblies before and after mine, are key stakeholders. For the overall machine to function, my subassembly must efficiently transfer energy. Specifically, it must transmit at least 90% of the energy it receives as input to ensure smooth integration with their designs.</p>

            <h3>Instructor</h3>
            <p>The instructor oversees the project's success, ensuring that each subassembly is functional, meets the project guidelines, and adheres to fundamental engineering principles. They also require that my subassembly be completed on time and align with technical and functional specifications. Additionally, thorough documentation and reflection on the design process, including design decisions and problem-solving strategies, are essential to meet the instructor's expectations.</p>

            <h3>Users of the Machine</h3>
            <p>Future engineers or students studying mechanical design may use this subassembly as a learning tool. For these users, it is important that the design is well-documented, with clear explanations of the engineering principles involved. The subassembly should be understandable and replicable by someone with basic engineering knowledge. Moreover, the entire machine must operate smoothly, from the first subassembly to the last, to serve as an effective educational example.</p>
        </section>

       <section class="section">
            <h2>Existing Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>Rube Goldberg machines often utilize a wide variety of mechanisms to create intricate chain reactions. Here are some common mechanisms typically employed in these machines:</p>

            <ul class="requirements-list">
                <li><strong>Levers:</strong> Simple levers are used to amplify force or trigger movements. They are often integrated with other mechanisms like pulleys and ramps.</li>
                <li><strong>Pulleys:</strong> Pulleys help change the direction of force, making them ideal for lifting or lowering objects in a sequence.</li>
                <li><strong>Inclined Planes:</strong> Ramps allow objects to roll or slide, transferring kinetic energy to the next step in the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Domino Chains:</strong> A classic feature in many machines, domino chains rely on potential energy stored in vertical pieces to create a cascading effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Mechanisms:</strong> Springs store potential energy, which can be released to move objects or create forceful impacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotational Elements:</strong> Gears, spinning disks, or rotating arms are used to transmit motion in creative ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical Components:</strong> Simple circuits and switches can add a mechatronic element, incorporating lights, sounds, or motorized movements.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Three of these mechanisms are explored in detail below:</p>

            <h3>Domino Knockdown Mechanism</h3>
            <img src="https://content.instructables.com/FZ8/2KLE/IUYD2BQN/FZ82KLEIUYD2BQN.jpg" alt="Domino Knockdown Mechanism" class="left-image-small">
            <p>A popular subassembly in Rube Goldberg machines involves a series of dominoes that, when knocked down in sequence, trigger the next action.</p>
	    <p>The dominos are usually made of wood, plastic, or metal, with uniform size and weight. The mechanism relies on the principle of potential energy stored 
		in the standing dominoes, which is converted into kinetic energy when the first domino is pushed over. This energy transfer creates a chain reaction, knocking down the 
		entire series in a mesmerizing display.<p><p> The mechanism is versatile and can serve as a transitional phase in a Rube Goldberg machine, where the falling dominoes trigger 
		subsequent actions like hitting a lever, pressing a button, or releasing a ball.<p>
	&nbsp
	&nbsp
		<h3>Ball Drop Mechanism</h3>
            <img src="https://www.eliwhitney.org/sites/default/files/styles/span-2/public/rube.jpg?itok=eOu0wl-D%22" alt="Ball Drop Mechanism" class="right-image">
            <p>The Ball Drop Mechanism is a dynamic and versatile component commonly featured in Rube Goldberg machines, valued for its ability to trigger subsequent actions 
            with precision and energy. This mechanism typically involves releasing a ball from a height, allowing gravity to accelerate it down a track, chute, or free fall onto a 
            target. The ball's motion can activate a wide variety of outcomes, such as striking a lever, knocking over dominos, or hitting a switch. The design capitalizes on 
            gravitational potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy as the ball descends.</p>
            <p>Key design considerations include the size, weight, and material of the ball, as these factors influence its speed and impact force. Additionally, the track or chute must 
            be designed to minimize friction and ensure a smooth, controlled descent. This mechanism's adaptability allows it to be incorporated into various stages of the machine, 
            serving as both a transition and an action initiator.</p>
        

          <h3>Pulley System Mechanism</h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/09/6709-050-AED3F7B5/Block-tackle.jpg" alt="Pulley system" class="left-image-small">
            <p>The Pulley System Mechanism is a fundamental and versatile component in Rube Goldberg machines, widely appreciated for its ability to transfer force, alter the direction of 
		motion, and create dynamic chain reactions. This mechanism consists of one or more wheels with a grooved edge, over which a rope, cable, or belt is looped. Pulleys can be arranged in 
		single or multiple configurations, depending on the desired effect, such as lifting a weight, triggering a lever, or controlling the movement of another component. The pulley system 
		operates on the principles of mechanical advantage, using tension in the rope to transmit force efficiently and redirect energy flow within the machine.</p>
		<p>Key design factors include the size and material of the pulley, the type of rope or cable used, and the alignment of components to ensure smooth operation. A well-designed 
		pulley system can amplify force, reduce friction, and provide precise control over the timing and movement of interconnected elements.<p>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Design Requirements</h2>
    <p>The design of the Rube Goldberg machine subassembly must meet the following specifications, addressing the needs of various stakeholders:</p>
    <ul class="requirements-list">
        <li>The subassembly must receive an input force of at least 2 N from the preceding subassembly and output a force of at least 1.5 N to the next subassembly.</li>
        <li>The subassembly must transfer at least 90% of input energy, minimizing energy loss through friction or inefficiency.</li>
        <li>The subassembly must be completed and fully functional by the project deadline, which is the end of the term.</li>
        <li>The subassembly must operate continuously without failure or stalling for the duration of its function.</li>
        <li>Materials used must have a tensile strength of at least 50 MPa to ensure durability under normal operational loads.</li>
        <li>The subassembly must include at least one moving component to enhance its visual appeal.</li>
        <li>The subassembly must demonstrate at least two mechanical principles (e.g., force transfer or simple machines) through interactive components.</li>
        <li>The subassembly should be producible for no more than $100 per unit.</li>
        <li>The subassembly's documentation must clearly describe the design process and engineering principles with 90% accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By addressing these specifications, the subassembly ensures functionality, durability, educational value, and cost-effectiveness while meeting the diverse expectations of stakeholders.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>List of Functions</h2>
    <p>The following list outlines the sequence of functions performed by the subassembly prepared using Stone's Taxonomy:</p>
    <ol class="functions-list">
        <li><strong>Receiving Force:</strong> Receive force from a preceding subassembly.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure the Force:</strong> Using a measurement device, measure the force and convert it into electrical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Rotational Motion:</strong> Use the force data to create rotational motion of equivalent magnitude.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Potential Energy:</strong> Use the rotational motion to load a mechanism storing potential energy (e.g., spring).</li>
        <li><strong>Release Stored Energy:</strong> Release the stored energy and create guided linear motion.</li>
        <li><strong>Trigger the Activation of a Simple Machine:</strong> Use the linear motion to trigger a simple machine (e.g., pulley) to change the direction of the force.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Force to Set in Motion Guided Linear Motion:</strong> Direct the force to initiate guided linear motion through the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Trigger Switch to an Electrical Device:</strong> Use the linear motion to activate a switch for an electrical device.</li>
        <li><strong>Generate Force:</strong> Use mechanical or electrical means to generate force required for further motion.</li>
        <li><strong>Pass the Force Along to the Next Subassembly:</strong> Transfer the force generated to the subsequent subassembly for continued operation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This list ensures that each functional step is captured and clearly communicated as part of the larger system design.</p>

    <h2>Reflection on the Design Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Initial Concept Development:</strong> The first step in my project was brainstorming ideas for my part of the Rube Goldberg machine. I realized early on that it was easy to focus on individual components—like motors, levers, or pulleys—rather than the functions each part was supposed to serve. I spent a lot of time thinking about how energy would transfer, how movement would be triggered, and how each step would interact with the next. This process was challenging, but it pushed me to think about the system as a whole, not just as a collection of parts. Sketching the components helped, but it was more helpful to focus on their roles and how they would contribute to the larger design.</p>

    <p><strong>Iterating the Design Based on Inputs/Outputs:</strong> Once I had a rough idea of how the subassembly would work, I needed to make sure each part’s input and output lined up with the rest of the system. Having a list of functional requirements definitely helped with this. Creating multiple functional designs and then later weeding them out to get the best one was the best strategy for this.</p>

    <p><strong>Modeling/CAD:</strong> Coming into the project with basic CAD skills, I found the modeling phase to be the most challenging part of the process. Although I had a rough concept of how the parts would fit together, translating that into precise CAD models required a lot of attention to detail and problem-solving. The CAD models were invaluable because they allowed me to visualize the design in three dimensions, providing insights that weren’t obvious in the initial sketches. For example, I was able to identify areas where the components might not fit together physically or where there could be clearance issues. This visualization also helped me understand which sections of the design would work well in the real world and which needed adjustments. CAD gave me the chance to refine my ideas before committing to building the physical system, reducing the likelihood of errors during the fabrication phase. The modeling process also highlighted areas where I could simplify or optimize the design, making it more practical and efficient. While challenging, this phase helped me to make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes during the prototyping phase.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p><strong>Focus on Functional Mapping from the Start:</strong> One of the most significant lessons I learned during this project is the 
importance of starting with a clear focus on the functions of the system before diving into component selection. In future projects, I recommend 
prioritizing functional mapping during the concept development phase. This means determining how energy will transfer, what each step will achieve, 
and how each part interacts with others before deciding on the components.</p>
    <p>To improve this in future projects, I would begin by sketching a functional flowchart to represent the sequence of actions and energy 
transfers in the system. I would then build the components based on the functional requirements, not simply component availability or preference. 
This approach will help ensure that each component directly contributes to achieving the system's goals, minimizing the need for major revisions later in the design process.</p>

    <h2>1. Focus on Functional Mapping from the Start</h2>
    <p>One of the most significant lessons I learned during this project is the importance of starting with a clear focus on the functions of the system before diving into detailed design or simulation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Prioritize functional mapping during the concept development phase. Determine energy transfer pathways, define what each step will achieve, and understand how each part interacts with others before progressing to simulations or virtual modeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Begin by sketching a functional flowchart to represent the sequence of actions and energy transfers in the system. Use this flowchart to guide virtual design decisions and ensure every aspect of the system fulfills the intended functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Develop Virtual Subsystem Simulations</h2>
    <p>While physical prototypes weren’t required, testing and refining virtual subsystems during the design phase can help identify issues early.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Create virtual subsystem models and simulate their functionality before integrating them into the full system.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Use virtual modeling tools to build simplified subsystem models that allow for quick simulations and testing. Validate their performance within isolated environments before incorporating them into the larger virtual system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Invest More Time in CAD Modeling and Simulation</h2>
    <p>Although CAD modeling and simulation were part of the process, dedicating additional time to refining virtual models could improve results.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Dedicate more time to creating detailed CAD models and performing simulations to identify potential design flaws.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Develop detailed CAD models for each component, including virtual simulations to test factors such as energy transfer, motion, and timing. Use these models to predict system behavior and iterate on designs before full integration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Establish a Formal Testing Protocol for Virtual Systems</h2>
    <p>Without a structured virtual testing protocol, identifying and resolving issues can become challenging.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement a formalized virtual testing process where each subsystem is thoroughly evaluated before full integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Create a testing schedule that specifies the exact inputs, expected outputs, and performance benchmarks for each virtual subsystem. Document results after every virtual simulation, identifying discrepancies and making necessary adjustments before integration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Improve Documentation and Communication</h2>
    <p>While documentation was maintained during the project, better organization and more frequent updates would have improved clarity and collaboration.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Establish a consistent documentation strategy that includes detailed design logs, simulation outcomes, and iteration histories.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Use shared tools or platforms to track project progress and design changes. Document key decisions, simulation results, and system integration challenges in detail for future reference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Prioritize Time Management and Scheduling</h2>
    <p>Time management played a critical role in balancing design, simulation, and troubleshooting.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Create a more structured timeline with accurate estimates for each project phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Develop a detailed timeline with specific goals for virtual design, modeling, and simulation phases. Build in buffers for unexpected challenges and conduct regular progress reviews to ensure deadlines are met.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Consider Collaboration and Peer Review</h2>
    <p>Collaboration with peers can offer valuable insights and alternative solutions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Incorporate regular peer reviews or team discussions to gather feedback on virtual designs, simulations, and system functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Schedule regular virtual check-ins with team members or mentors to discuss progress and challenges. Allocate time for peer reviews at critical stages, such as after completing CAD models or virtual testing, to leverage diverse expertise.</li>
    </ul>
